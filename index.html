    Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
    And every night has its day, so magical
    And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
    That can't be defeated
    
    For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
    In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
    For every dreamer, a dream â€” we're unstoppable
    With something to believe in
    
    Monday left me broken
    Tuesday I was through with hoping
    Wednesday my empty arms were open
    Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
