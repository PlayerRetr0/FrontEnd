        Well, I will call you darlin' and everything will be okay<br>
        Cause I know that I am yours and you are mine<br>
        Doesn't matter anyway<br>
        In the night, we'll take a walk, it's nothin' funny<br>
        Just to talk<br>
        <br>
        Put your hand in mine<br>
        You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        Until I make you mine<br>
        <br>
        Well, I have called you darlin' and I'll say it
        <a name href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eiYQhTt--Q" target="_blank"> again,</a><br>
        So kiss me 'til I'm sorry, babe, that you are gone and I'm a mess<br>
        And I'll hurt you and you'll hurt me and we'll say things we can't repeat<br>
        <br>
        Put your hand in mine<br>
        You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        Until I make you mine<br>
        <br>
        You need to know<br>
        We'll take it slow<br>
        I miss you so<br>
        We'll take it slow<br>
        It's hard to feel you slipping (you need to know)<br>
        Through my fingers are so numb (we'll take it slow)<br>
        And how was I supposed to know (I miss you so)<br>
        That you were not the one?<br>
        <br>
        Put your hand in mine
        You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        Until I make you mine<br>
        <br>
        Put your hand in mine
        You know that I want to be with you all the time<br>
        Oh darlin', darlin', baby, you're so very fine<br>
        You know that I won't stop until I make you mine<br>
        Until I make you<br>
